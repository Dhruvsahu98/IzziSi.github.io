            &nbsp;&nbsp; Nonna's Kitchen family restaurant is a family run restaurant. 
            The Palumbo family has worked hard to keep their traditions and tastes the same,
            as our Nonnas of each generation have passed on. Each recipe has been made special,
            all personally created by family.
            <br>
            <br> 
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Our hope is to bring love and home-cooked food
            to you. To accept you as family, and treat you to an Italian household meal,
            brought to you from Caianello, Italia.
